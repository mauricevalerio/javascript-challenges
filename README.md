## Scrimba Module 13 JavaScript Challenges

Part of [Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend). 

A series of JavaScript problem solving challenges. 

## Reflection
Surprisingly found myself having a hard time more on String manipulation rather than Array manipulation problems maybe because of I am more familiar with array callbacks which makes working with each array elements much easier rather than working with arrays imperatively using loops.
